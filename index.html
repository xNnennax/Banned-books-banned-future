        <h1> Introduction </h1>
        <p>
          There are many diferent social issues in the world lke racism , sexism , unemployment etc.
          There is one that is not talked about enough and this is the topic of book bans. Book bans
          are when a certain book is banned because they are deemed to have too much inappropriate 
          content such as racism, sexism, sexually explicit, offensive language, etc. Since this is the case, some
          parents are not ready to expose their kids to content like this.
        </p>
        <h3> Why is it important books don't get banned?</h3>
        <p>
         Banned books might seem like they ae awful but they aren't. Banned books actually teach 
         important life lessons one might not get in school or anywhere else. These lessons are 
         very important because they tell life as it is .

            This loopy is supposed to show how when parents don't want their kids exposed 
            to certain books, the books get banned . When these books get banned, more
            people lose common knowledge and there is  less knowledge of the past . When
            that happens, history repeats itself and past problems become future ones. This
            loopy is supposed to show you why banning can affect everyone sooner or later.

        In the nation of Ulistan lives a young brown girl named Kiki. Her homeland in colonized by Silish government .
        They are corrupt and they try to rid Ulistan of their culture by banning important the history from younger 
        generations. This involves the banning of books, types of media and they set behavioral standards.Kiki had 
        already grown up with Ulistan traditions and as she ages, she realizes the changes made around her by the Silish
        government . Libraries and schools are taken down and there are certain books she cannot read . She is 
        forced to go under a new identity as a Slish resident but it makes her uncomfortable . She soon starts 
        stealing history books about Ulistan and educates the younger generation of their nation's history.
        </p>
        <h3>Character and set  degin</h3>
           <p>
               Kiki has long black hair and brown skin. She wears a pink dress with a heart on it .
               The scences were handrawn and colored . They are also pop ups in the video. Some 
               scenes like the library were reused . The tress were as well. We mixed in some 3d 
               and 2d shapes into our animation. 3D like a few characters and 2 of the books but 2d 
               for everything else.
            </p>

      To make this video, we used dragonframe software to take pictures and put the video together, 
      we did this by changing the scenes and moving characters to seem as if they were really moving.
      Once this was done, we would take a picture and move te character again. We were going to use 
      the Makecode Tutorial an project programs for lighting but we decided not to . We also 
      considered using it in our second scene when it snowed.
