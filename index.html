        <h1> Introduction </h1>
        <p>
          There are many diferent social issues in the world lke racism , seism , unemployment etc.
          There is one that is not talked about enough and this is the topic of book bans. Book bans
          are when a certain book is banned because they are deemed to have too much inappropriate 
          content such as racism, sexism, sexually explicit, offensive language, etc. Since this is the case, some
          parents are not ready to expose their kids to content like this.
        </p>
        <h3> Why is it important books don't get banned?</h3>
        <p>
         Banned books might seem like they ae awful but they aren't. Banned books actually teach 
         important life lessons one might not get in school or anywhere else. These lessons are 
         very important because they tell life as it is .

        <p>
            This loopy is supposed to show how when parents don't want their kids exposed 
            to certain books, the books get banned . When these books get banned, more
            people lose common knowledge and there is  less knowledge of the past . When
            that happens, history repeats itself and past problems become future ones. This
            loopy is supposed to show you why banning can affect everyone sooner or later.
